# Distortion-Pedal-Construction

Hi! This is a project under a 30 member-organization Sheffield Sound Systems, that build and produce audio equipments. 
The first 3-4 weeks of the project would focus on understanding and constructing the schematics of the circuit. 
From week 5 to week 9, the project would focus on building the pcb using open source software like KiCad.
Later week after christmas would be assembly and testing, with the aim of being able to use the pedal on a live gig.
